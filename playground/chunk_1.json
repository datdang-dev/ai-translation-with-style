  "139": "Yes, precisely then! However did you know, dearie?",
  "140": "Eh, you were bitchin' about your knees, and that necklace of yours is from the Bertoli Collection. They only made that exact one 25 years ago, and that shit didn't cost a dollar...",

  "154": "(Weird, I can't get a read on this guy. Haven't seen his ass around here before, but he's too prim and proper to be random trailer trash.)",
