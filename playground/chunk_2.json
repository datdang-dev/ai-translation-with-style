  "294": "So, how was your trip?",
  "295": "It was boring so I made a list of the things I have to do here...",
  "296": "...and I definitely started getting my hands {i}firmly{/i} wrapped around a few things (if you know what I mean).",
  "297": "Interesting. Planning is a good academic habit. It can make you feel safer and more organized and prevent nasty surprises.",

  "299": "Good, you won’t be tired for school tomorrow then.",
  "300": "I was sitting right behind a sexy chick. I enjoyed the view.",

  "307": "Well thanks, I made a lot of money recently and my business is only just getting started.",
  "308": "What business exactly?",
  "309": "Import/export. I travel a lot. Actually, that brings us to the other reason I invited you for the year.",
  "310": "Hop in, let’s talk about this on our way home.",
  "311": "I've gotta be straight with you; the women of the house have their doubts about what I'm doing...",
  "312": "Especially Tomoe, your mother... she feels guilty about you... she's filled with regret... but I think it's time you two can move on and build something together, right?",
  "313": "Sure. I feel the need to reconnect with her too.",
  "314": "There! See, I knew you had grown enough to overcome the past. That's a relief, she was scared that you wouldn’t forgive her.",
  "315": "So... the main reason I asked you to come stay with us... is because I will be moving overseas in two days and I'll be there for over a year.",
  "316": "With the crazy demands of work, I’ll only be able to come back two or three days a month; that’s why I need a man at home, someone to protect and watch over my family.",
  "317": "I see, but what about Sheila?",
  "318": "Your stepsister isn't a little girl anymore. She wants to be treated like a grown-up, and I overheard her talking about boys on one of her phone calls.",
  "319": "She's also wanting to go out at night with her friends a lot more often. I'm counting on you to be the man of the house.",
  "320": "I doubt she'll listen to me if I start telling her not to go out.",
  "321": "Oh, I know. That's Tomoe’s duty. Your role will be more of a deterrent against a potential boyfriend {b}{i}haha{/i}{/b}!",
  "322": "It's gonna be alright! I'm sure you’ll be able to handle things, so I can sleep without worry while I'm away.",
  "323": "Believe me, you’ll love the family!",
  "324": "(Oh, you have no idea...)",
  "325": "8:10pm Schweizer House",
  "326": "I’m pretty sure they’re waiting up for us.",
  "327": "I hope we don't get scolded for being late.",
  "328": "We're home!",
  "329": "Welcome home, honey!",
  "330": "You guys are late!",
  "331": "Hey, sorry it's so late...",
  "332": "Welcome, [player_name].",
  "333": "{i}Hmm...{/i} you're taller than I remember.",
  "334": "That’s good, we don't need a shrimp in the house.",
  "335": "Well, thanks, I guess...",
  "336": "You've grown too. You're looking like a real woman, Sheila.",
  "337": "See! {i}He{/i} noticed. I keep telling Mom and Dad that I’m not a little girl anymore.",
  "338": "(Indeed. She’s developed some nice boobs and hips, she’s a woman now. I didn't notice the other day since she stayed in the car.)",
  "339": "Oh Sheila, please don't start a quarrel {i}now{/i}, your dad just got back.",
  "340": "Sorry Dad! Did you buy me something?",
  "341": "Nope, but I will if you're civil to our guest for the next month.",
  "342": "Tomoe, can you show the house to [player_name], so he can check if all his belongings arrived?",
  "343": "Sure, honey. [player_name], follow me please.",
  "344": "(The living room. There's no one else here.)",
  "345": "(The bathroom. There's no one else here.)",
  "346": "Upstairs. Tomoe is waiting at the end of the corridor...",
  "347": "All of the bedrooms are on this floor.",
  "348": "This is your room. You can do your own thing in privacy here.",
  "349": "But don't be too noisy at night, the walls are thin.",
  "350": "Roger!",
  "351": "Across the hall is the room I share with George... although I guess I'll just be sharing it with myself for a while.",
  "352": "You can come ask me anything, but don't forget to knock before entering.",
  "353": "Of course.",
  "354": "Yeah! You better {i}always{/i} knock before opening doors!",
  "355": "And don't {b}ever{/b} open my door without my permission!",
  "356": "Sure, but don't worry, I have better things to do than looking in your room...",
  "357": "Well, we both know what perverts men are. At some point, you'll try to peek at me.",
  "358": "Well, I think you overestimate your attractiveness, Sheila...",
  "359": "{b}WHAAAT?!!{/b}",
  "360": "Sheila, please!",
  "361": "[player_name], don't pay any attention to her. She's just teasing.",
  "362": "{b}{i}Haha{/i}{/b} It's okay, we are just getting to know each other.",
  "363": "Please take a look around your room and see if the movers forgot anything.",
  "364": "Alright.",
  "365": "(Well, my books and manga are here, my TV too...)",
  "366": "Cool! A weight bench! I guess this was their exercise room before I arrived.",
  "367": "(Okay, let's start the operation...)",
  "368": "(This is how the game will progress -)",
  "369": "(Step one: Take control of this family so that I can act freely.)",
  "370": "(One way or another, I'll punish Mother for abandoning me and make Sheila my loyal pet.)",
  "371": "(Then I will investigate the school and town, find the people who destroyed my dad, and discover why.)",
  "372": "(I will make a list of those people. It will probably take about a week...)",
  "373": "(Then I'll move on to step two: I will act against them one-by-one in order to amass some money.)",
  "374": "(Each week, I will pick a target from the list and either corrupt or blackmail them. Eventually, they will all serve me.)",
  "375": "(When I’ve gathered enough workers and money, I’ll buy back my school!)",
  "376": "(Get my revenge, get back my school, and {i}enjoy{/i} my new life as Master!)",
  "377": "[[{b}{i}BOOM!BOOM!BOOM!{/i}{/b}]",
  "378": "*deafened* {b}Wha!? How can I think with someone's music pounding in my ears!?{/b}",
  "379": "(The door's open but there's nobody there.)",

  "381": "(I can't even think!)",

  "383": "Of course she can't hear me knocking with her music blasting.",
  "384": "(Wait! The door isn't fully closed! I can see her.)",
  "385": "(Seems I'm getting a little Welcoming Show...)",
  "386": "(Nice! She's dancing in her underwear.)",
  "387": "(She's making a liar out of me after I said she lacked sexiness.)",
  "388": "({b}Dammit!{/b} I left my phone in my room. I can't take a picture.)",
  "389": "(Yeah, shake that nice little ass.)",
  "390": "(Can't believe I’m already peeping on sis.)",
  "391": "(From here those breasts seem to be C cups.)",
  "392": "(Look who's here...)",
  "393": "(Didn't take long for him to fall into my trap {b}{i}Heh heh heh{/i}{/b})",
  "394": "({b}Gotcha!{/b})",
  "395": "(Why did she freeze?)",
  "396": "What are you doing here, pervert!",
  "397": "Oh Shit!\\n(She's spotted me!)",
  "398": "{b}{i}AAAAAAH!!{/i}{/b} WHAT ARE YOU DOING!??",
  "399": "{b}{i}AAAAAAH!!{/i}{/b} MOM, DAD!!!! COME HERE!",
  "400": "(I’m totally screwed!)",
  "401": "Sheila! What's going on? Why are you screaming like that?",
  "402": "[player_name] snuck into my room and peeped on me while I was changing!",
  "403": "Is that true, [player_name]?",
  "404": "Don't tell me there's already drama between you two less than an hour under the same roof.",
  "405": "I’m sorry. I went to Sheila's room to ask her to turn her music down.",
  "406": "I had to knock twice, but her door wasn't latched and it popped open...",
  "407": "Yeah, maybe the music covered your knocking, but I swear my door was closed, Mom.",
  "408": "And you still watched me in my underwear without saying anything. You’re a pervert, just like your dad!",
  "409": "Sheila, stop! Don't talk about that!",
  "410": "Okay, calm down everyone. It's obviously just a big misunderstanding.",
  "411": "I heard your music all the way downstairs, so I know that [player_name] didn't make that up just to peek at you.",
  "412": "Still you guys leave me no choice but to keep tabs on you! I don't want your mother to be stressed out while I’m away.",
  "413": "So I'm going to call Tomoe for a daily recap every evening this week.",
  "414": "If I hear about any misbehavior from you, [player_name], or you, Sheila, you won’t receive any pocket money.",
  "415": "Go take a shower, [player_name]. From now on you'll always shower after the girls so there are no slip-ups.",
  "416": "Sure George. I'm really sorry; it won't happen again.",
  "417": "*She gives you the Razzberry*",
  "418": "(You're not getting my allowance money from Dad if I can help it!)",
  "419": "You take a quick shower."
